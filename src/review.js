            <h2>Debbie S. Brannon -Fellow GA Alumni.</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Conner and I are enrolled in a Software Engineering Bootcamp together.
            Not only does he have an execellent grasp on the material, but he shares
            his knowledge with other members of the group. He played a tremendous role in
            stregnthing my confidence in React through his recommendations of outside
            resources. Conner is an incredible team player.

            <h2>Tracey Lucero ~ 2017</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Conner has a great personality, and is very approachable and a hard worker.
                    Conner continues to show his worth and value for the department and CoorsTek.
                    I would like him to continue on his path, and great things will be in his future.
                </li>
                <li>Conner has been dilligent on completing his weekly clean up and monthly pm
                    in a timely manner. Conner swiftly completes tasks that are assigned to him
                    outside of his regular duties.
                </li>
                <li>Conner does a good job of making internal customers a priority. He works hard
                    to minimize scrap for each department by addressing kiln issues when issues
                    arise.
                </li>
                <li>Conner works well in a team atmosphere by helping his team mates in whatever they need.
                    Conner works the graveyard shift and having a forklift license, allows him
                    to change tanks for the press operators since they don't always have forklift
                    operators on the graveyard shift.
                </li>
                <li>Conner does a good job bringing up issues within the department and can do
                    so without disrespecting his fellow team members. With the ammount of time
                    Conner has been in the department, I would like to see him to take more of a
                    leadership role with the newer firemen.
                </li>
                <li>Conner is accountable for his actions, but I want him to be more vested in
                    how actions of others in the department can have an impact on the team. I.e.
                    when he sees other team members not preforming to an acceptable level, address
                    their behavior. To let them (other team members) know, that their actions
                    can affect the team as a whole.
                </li>
                <li>Conner dows a great job in making improvements in the department. By painting
                    areas to give them new life. Conner continues looking at ways to make improvements
                    in and around the department. I would like to see Conner give feedback on
                    ways to upgrade aging equipment and to help move the firing group towards better
                    equipment and controls.

            <ul>
                <li>Conner works well with others and is easy to work with. He does a good job
                    of working with his partneres to achieve a larger outcomes than he would
                    be capable of on his own. In addition I believe he does a good job of
                    asking for help to make hobs safer on the off shift and not taking any
                    chances by trying to complete a task on his own.

                </li>

                <li>Conner works hard and stays engaged during his shift and is proactive when
                    it comes to improving the work environment by organizing and cleaning. He

                    to cover shifts. Conner works well with the group. He has good attention

                    with Ryan Stutheit our newest Tech and has done a great job of working with
                    him, training him on issues as they arise.

                <li>Successfully trained new graveyard employee on all kilns that have not moved
                    out of the plant. Not to take away from his efforts, he does a great job
                    every day all shift long.He brings attention to details, and a great understanding
                    to both night shifts.
                </li>
                <li>Conner and Howard have worked together to create an improved checklist. This
                    checklist is updated with the current kilns and eliminates waste by eliminating
                    checks on items that are no longer in service.

                    do his job with less waste embracing the 8 wastes. I believe that Conner's
                    willingness to help guid Ryan shows his commitment to reducing waste as well
                    as create a culture in the department of problem solving and collaboration.
